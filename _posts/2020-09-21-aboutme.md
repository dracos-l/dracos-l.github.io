## My CS experience

 My main CS experience is within Horace Mann. After taking the no longer available CS1 in 9th grade, I joined CS2 after a couple days of school and really enjoyed the class. Throughout the year, we learned how to operate a terminal, we became versed in both Java and Python, as well as spending some time problem solving using greenfoot and the greeps program. Past that, I took a two-week long ID Tech course on python(which was slightly redundant) and machine learning, where I familiarized myself with Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, and some basic machine learning models(where I ended the year with a [minor project](https://www.codersarts.com/forum/machine-learning-projects/machine-learning-project-help-fake-news-detection) involving a fake news dataset using a LSTM).

## My Favorite Basketball Team

  I am a big fan of the _Boston Celtics_ NBA team. Right now they are competing against the Maimi Heat in the [Eastern Conference finals](https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2020/eastseries7). The Celtics are lead by young star __Jayson Taytum__, and the Heat are led by veteran __Jimmy Butler__. As of Sunday, September 20, the Heat are up 2-1 on the Celtics,with the Celtics losing games 1 and 2 but taking game 3 with the help of just-recovered All-Star __Gordon Hayward__. It will be interesting to see how the Celtics fair going forward with their reinforced lineup and the momentum going into game 4 on Wednesday, September 2020. My prediction, is that the Celtics will put up a good effort, as they are the better team, but the 2-0 hole that they started in will be too difficult to come out of.

## This Year

 I think that this upcoming year will be quite the interesting one, not only because of the strict conditions we will be under until Thanksgiving break, but also the online school for the weeks after, as well as how Horace Mann handles the spring. My personal hope is that when the vaccine is widely spread(which will likely be around [March](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/sep/20/covid-vaccine-tracker-when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready) for complete vaccination of the HM community), we can go back to normal school! I am looking forward to having a true classroom enviornment, not only for CS, but also for all of my other classes, and especially for extracurriculars!
