### The study I looked at

 For this assignment, I went to google to try to find one of the most recent coronavirus vaccine studies, to see how the data they're giving on this race for a cure can be looked at to see how it may be under the umbrella of questionable data like we looked at in class. The study was taking two possible vaccine candidates, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, and seeing how some age groups reacted to certain doses.

## Analyze and question the data that the scientists use.

 The scientists had four total groups, two for each vaccine. The two groups were ages 18-55 and ages 65-85. They have varying doses to subgroups, as well as placebo. To simplify the discussion of their groupings, here is a graphic they provided: ![.](https://www.nejm.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/0/nejm.ahead-of-print/nejmoa2027906/20201014/images/img_xlarge/nejmoa2027906_f1.jpeg)
 They then had the subjects report any side effects of the treatment, and this conssited of their study. There are several problems with their data collection that could possibly make their findings a reach, or straight untrue. First, they are asking these subjects to report on any side effects that _they_ feel are because of the vaccine. The subjects could just be feeling a cold independent of the vaccine, or they could have placebo, although the study did set aside a placebo group to partly negate this. Secondly, The ages and health of the groups even within age groups could vary, causing some groups to report more intese symptoms despite the dose not corresponding. Overall, this method of data gathering depends a lot on the independency of other events and the honesty of the subjects.

## Analyze their results. Do you trust their findings? Why or why not?

 I think that their findings are true, but only to an extent. The fact that from a couple to nearly 50% of the subjects who had placebo reported symptoms means that, at least partially, some of the other groups likely have symptoms for the same reason. However other than this, the data through both age groups looks fairly consistent and goes up with the dosage amount, which partially dispells the likelihood of placebo affecting it.


## How might "publish or perish" have affected this study?

 Publish or perish definitely had influence on this study. The pressure for the race to a vaccine is extremely high, and whichever company comes out with one is facing massive profits. If the findings of this study hadn't been relevant, not only would the people involve suffer, but several others within their organization.
